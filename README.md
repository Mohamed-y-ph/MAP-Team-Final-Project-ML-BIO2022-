This notbook is a supervised machine learning work created by MAP team members for the fulfillment of graduation requirements in the ML-Bio 2022 Course in BCB diploma
The work was done on an RNA gene expression data by Phoebe Magdy, Abdel-Hady Sayed, and Mohamed Ali.

Our workflow was done as following:
1- Preprocessing of our data
2- Choice of different ML models and validation metrics
3- Initial testing of the chosen models
4- Hyperparameter tuning
5- Cross validation
6- Finding important features
7- Generalizing our model for external test data
